Hello — welcome to this blog.

I write short, practical posts about building things on the web: static sites, developer tooling, deployment tips, and configuration notes. This site is built with **Hugo** and the **PaperMod** theme.

What you'll find here

- Concise how‑tos and cheat‑sheets
- Code snippets and configuration examples
- Project retrospectives and lessons learned
- Quick reference posts for daily workflows

How to use the blog

- Browse posts from the home page or tags
- Preview locally with: `hugo server -D`

If you're here to learn fast:

2. Use the summary preview to scan posts quickly.
